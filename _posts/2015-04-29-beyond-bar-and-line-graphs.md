PLOS Biology recently published a nice article on data visualization:

It argues that we can do better than showing data as bars of mean height with error bars indicating standard deviations. In my lab, we use many of the proposed techniques already, see e.g. Fig. 4 in [this paper.](https://peerj.com/articles/211/) However, I'm glad that I now have a simple reference I can point people to when I want them to reconsider their figures.
